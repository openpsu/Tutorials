# OpenPSU Basics
- Git and Github
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38863493/181713720-bf3c2b60-a4a6-451a-9be8-c01dc10d2ece.png)
  - To contribute code in OpenPSU's project repository, it is beneficial to learn what Git and Github are, and what they do.
  - Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
  - GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
  - Here are some suggested tutorials to develop these skills: (I recommend starting with FreeCodeCamp's beginners crash-course
    - [FreeCodeCamp's Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
    - [Git for Professionals Tutorial - Tools & Concepts for Mastering Version Control with Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uszj_k0DGsg&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
    - [Advanced Git Tutorial - Interactive Rebase, Cherry-Picking, Reflog, Submodules and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsTthZi23VE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
  
- [MIT's Missing CS course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/):

# Technology Development
- ## Full Stack Development
  - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com): The Odin Project is a coding bootcamp that provides an open-source curriculum to students who want to learn to code but can't afford to join traditional education paths. The Odin Project's online programs cover languages like JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Ruby on Rails, and Node. I recommend starting from foundationals then take the javascript track.
  - [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/): Take control of React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript! The course introduces you to modern web application development using JavaScript. The content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki
